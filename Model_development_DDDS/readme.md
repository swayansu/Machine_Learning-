# Driver Drowsiness Detection using machine learning.
 
A driver drowsiness detection system is a technology that helps in preventing road accidents caused by driver fatigue. This system uses sensors, cameras, and algorithms to detect signs of drowsiness in drivers, such as eye blinks, head nods, and changes in driving behavior. Once the system detects drowsiness, it sends an alert to the driver, such as a visual or audio warning, to prompt them to take a break or stop driving. Some advanced driver drowsiness detection systems can also adjust the vehicle's speed or activate emergency braking to prevent accidents. This technology can significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by driver fatigue, making roads safer for everyone.
